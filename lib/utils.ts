/**
 *  Explanation
 *  clsx is sufficient for merging and conditionally applying classes.
 *  UnoCSS automatically handles conflicting classes (e.g., bg-red-500 vs. bg-blue-500) during build time, so you don’t need twMerge to resolve conflicts dynamically.
 *  Optional: Custom Conflict Resolution
 *  If you need more advanced class merging (e.g., resolving conflicts dynamically), you can write a custom utility function. However, this is rarely necessary with UnoCSS since it resolves styles at build time.
 *
 *  This change should work seamlessly with UnoCSS.
